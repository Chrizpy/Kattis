# Kattis

These are some fun programming problems that can be found at liu.kattis.com

I'll upload my best tries at some of the problems there, I've written my
solutions in C++. If you happen to beat my times... SHOW ME. 

Run time is fetched using this line of bash in the terminal
$ time ./your_program < sample.in > sample.out

Over here you can see how the problems are judged, it's pretty easy to find 
all the information needed on this website, just tossing it in here. :)
